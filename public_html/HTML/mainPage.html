            <p>Team Path Starters are working through the R9 Accelerator as part of a better 
                of business initiative. Their mission is to provide fulfilling employment for 
                those who are stuck on their journey.  57,000 people are currently receiving
                health related benefit due to the impact their mental health condition has on
                their ability to work. Mental health conditions have accounted for 97% of the
                growth in health-related benefits in the last 10 years, and this is part of an
                international trend.People with mental health conditions often have poor employment
                outcomes. There are a number of barriers that are preventing people from finding 
                and keeping a job. We know that appropriate work, combined with the right support,
                is good for peopleâ€™s mental health and that people with mental health conditions
                can and want to work.</p>
